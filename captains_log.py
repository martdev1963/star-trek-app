Acting Captain Spock Recording

Following the temporary reassignment of Captain Kirk to diplomatic duty on Melvarus IV, I have assumed command of the USS Enterprise. It is... not unpleasant.

We are en route to the Hektar Nebula to investigate a series of gravimetric anomalies detected by Starfleet probes. Early readings suggest that the region is undergoing quantum filament disruptionsâ€”irregular, but fascinating. Lieutenant Commander Scott described it as "the space equivalent of a bad hair day." I did not inquire further.

Ensign Chekov attempted evasive maneuvers during a routine navigation drill and managed to invert the ship's inertial dampeners. Though no injuries were sustained, Doctor McCoy referred to the resulting turbulence as "a Vulcan amusement ride." I find the concept illogical. Amusement is irrelevant to gravitational chaos.

Crew morale remains high, albeit noisy. Dr. McCoy insists that I "loosen up"â€”a recommendation he has repeated 14.2 times per week since I assumed command. I assured him that my facial expression was, in fact, one of serene contentment. He did not believe me. He never does.

As we approach the outer rim of the Hektar Nebula, I have ordered all senior officers to prepare for unexpected sensor interference, power fluctuations, and metaphysical phenomena. The last time we encountered a spatial anomaly of this magnitude, Lieutenant Uhura briefly spoke fluent Klingon, and Captain Kirk aged backward for three hours. It is imperative that we remain... flexible. Within reason.

Captain James T. Kirk Recording

We've entered orbit around the mysterious planet Sigma Iotia II. Initial scans show technology levels equivalent to Earth's 1920s, but with some... interesting adaptations of advanced technology they clearly don't understand.

Mr. Spock has identified what appears to be a primitive computer system running what he describes as "a remarkably accurate simulation of chess, if chess involved disruptors and orbital bombardments." I've ordered the landing party to proceed with extreme caution. The Prime Directive is in full effect, though McCoy insists that someone has already broken it, given the technology we're seeing.

I've assigned Lieutenant Uhura to analyze their communication systems, which seem to be based on some very creative interpretations of subspace technology. She reports that their primary means of communication involves small handheld devices that they refer to as "communicators," but which appear to be used primarily for sending pictures of what they're eating.

Mr. Scott has locked himself in engineering, muttering something about "criminal misuse of perfectly good antimatter containment fields." I'll check on him after the landing party returns.

Acting Captain Nyota Uhura Recording

With both Captain Kirk and Commander Spock attending the interplanetary linguistics conference on Vulcan, and Dr. McCoy refusing the "honor" (his words), command of the Enterprise has temporarily fallen to me. 

We're currently conducting routine mapping of the Beta Quadrant's outer rim when we picked up a most peculiar signalâ€”what appears to be an ancient Earth distress call, but with Klingon opera music playing in the background. Mr. Chekov insists this is impossible, while Ensign T'Lara has calculated a 97.8% probability that we're dealing with a temporal anomaly.

The crew has been surprisingly supportive of my temporary command, though Lt. Commander Scott did ask if this meant he could finally install that experimental warp coil he's been talking about. I told him he couldâ€”right after I finish reading the 3,000-page safety manual he wrote for it last year. He hasn't brought it up since.

Dr. McCoy just stopped by to tell me I'm doing "a damn fine job, for a comm officer." I'll take that as high praise coming from him.

            With Captain Kirk stranded on the surface of Sigma Draconis VI(having beamed down to "mediate" a dispute
            between two factions who, it turns out, were merely debating the proper seasoning
        for plomeek soup), I have resumed command.The crewâ€™s reaction was...mixed.Lieutenant Uhura smiled.Dr.McCoy groaned.Mr.Scott immediately asked if this meant he could "recalibrate the warp core without all the paperwork."

        We are currently towing a derelict Ferengi cargo vessel emitting erratic tachyon pulses.Initial scans suggest the shipâ€™s hold contains 47 cases of what Mr.Chekov insists is "vintage Romulan ale," but which Dr.McCoyâ€™s tricorder identifies as "barely potable engine coolant." The Ferengi crew abandoned ship after apparently losing a game of Tongo mid-warp.Curious.

        Dr.McCoy has just informed me that "command looks good" on me, though he qualified this by adding, "like a hat on a giraffe." I fail to see the relevance of Earth ungulates to starship operations.

            Captain James T.Kirk Recording
        Iâ€™ve retaken command from Spock after a particularly grueling diplomatic summit on Vulcan, where I was
        required to attend seven hours of debate on whether the word "illogical" is, itself, logical. 
        
        Mr.Spock seemed to enjoy it. I nearly chewed my own arm off. Weâ€™ve intercepted a distress call from a Klingon
        science vessel trapped in a temporal eddy. Their captain, Kor, claims theyâ€™ve been reliving the same 20 minutes
       
        for three weeks.Unfortunately, their solutionâ€”"shooting the anomaly with more torpedoes"â€”only made it worse. Mr.Spock suggests we
        try harmonics.Dr.McCoy suggests we "let them figure it out."
        Ensign Chekov just reported that the shipâ€™s chronometers are now displaying next weekâ€™s duty rosters.Lt.Uhura has started
       
        receiving comms from herself.And Mr.Scott, in a stroke of either genius or madness, has begun
        referring to the warp core as "she who must not be disturbed."
